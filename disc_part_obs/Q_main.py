This is the main file for a multi agent reinforcement learning application
where two agents compete in a discrete Bertrand environment, i.e. having price
as their strategic variable. The agents are able to see their own prices and
profits K periods back. They are unable to see each others prices and profits.

Question is, can they still learn how to cooperate?
