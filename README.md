What the project does:

This project aims to explore whether multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms can learn to collude in an economic environment. 

First, I replicate an existing paper inside "repl_calvano" (link to paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3304991). This paper establishes that MARL can indeed learn how to collude and serves as a benchmark for me to test that my code works. I.e. once I've replicated it I'm confident that the code is correct and can be taekn to the next step.

Once the code is able to replicate, I stick to the discrete environment and implement changes to the economic environment that are meaningful from an economic perspective. This is where a novel contribution of mine enters and the results will be presented in my MSc thesis at SSE/MA thesis at St. Gallen University

Finally, if time permits, I want to take the development one step further and make the observation space and action space continuous. This will require function approximation via deep learning (which are new techniques to me). This will allow me to explore a richer set of environments and make a larger contribution to the field.

Why the project is useful:

It contributes to the industrial organization litterature on tacit collusion in a digital age.
